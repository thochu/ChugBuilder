# ChugBuilder
This is a program designed to help the Shemesh Summer Camp create a schedule based off of parents' responses from SignUpGenius. 
NOTE: You will need a working implementation of FileLineIterator.java, which has been deleted from this repository due to concerns that the code
is similar to a code used for a class I have taken, which would violate my school's academic honor code. 

To use the program, create a folder withinChugBuilder named "files". In this folder, you need to place the data from SignUpGenius as a csv. Ensure this file is named
SignUpGenius.csv. Then, run the main method of the program, and in files, you will receive output1.csv and output2.csv, which will have the schedules built!
